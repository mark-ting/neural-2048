A terminal-based 2048 game written in Python.
Comes with pre-trained neural network AI and greedy AI.

Runtime Requirements:
 - Anaconda Python installation (http://continuum.io/downloads#py34)

    OR (if you want to install independently)

 - Python 3 installation (preferably Anaconda x64)
 - Scipy, Numpy libraries


Example:
    python runtime.py -a -n -l -v 2

Arguments:
    -a: Sets runtime to play 2048 with the AI

    -g: Makes the AI play greedily.
        [Presumes -a]

    -d: Sets the search depth of the greedy AI.
        [Presumes -g and -a]

    -s: Sets the board RNG seeding (placement of 2's, 4's)

    -l: Tells the runtime to log an AI run
        [Presumes -a]

    -v: Sets the verbosity of the output logs. Defaults to 1.
        Options:
            1 -- outputs move score and move count
            2 -- outputs all of 1 as well as the actual board grid
        [Presumes -a]
